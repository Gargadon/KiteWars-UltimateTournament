# Kite Wars Ultimate Tournament
"Kite Wars Ultimate Tournament" is the first of my own original story saga, now ported to Ren'Py.

## Plot
In an alternate universe, kites have been replaced by electronic kites piloted by an interactive remote control. This invention has created a whole line of toys that both children and adults can use to fight against other players, or "Kiters" as they are known in this world. The best known kite tournament in Japan is the "Ultimate Tournament", where children from all over the country participate by crashing their kites, leaving only one winner.

Kaito Ichihara is a fan of kites and Kiters, but his mother won't let him have a kite. An encounter with some strange thugs and a dark vigilante who uses his kite as a weapon, will allow him to have one of his own. His path to the "Ultimate Tournament" will bring him good friends, great rivals, a confrontation with an evil corporation and the possible whereabouts of his missing father.
