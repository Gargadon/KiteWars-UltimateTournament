I'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.

While running game code:
  File "renpy/common/00start.rpy", line 273, in script
    python:
  File "renpy/common/00start.rpy", line 273, in script
    python:

    renpy.call_in_new_context("_main_menu")
  File "renpy/common/00action_file.rpy", line 462, in __call__
    renpy.load(fn)
Exception: Couldn't find a place to stop rolling back. Perhaps the script changed in an incompatible way?
